# Lanyard Meteor Addon

This is a Meteor addon that I created to help me with my own development.
# Features
- **Crash Tests:** Includes various crash modules for testing purposes, such as `AbstractPacketFloodEraser`, `CommandFloodCrash`, and `VelocityCrash`.
- **ChatHelper:** Adds a GUI to any opened inventory, allowing you to type commands without closing the inventory. This is implemented via `ChatHelperScreenMixin`.
- **CommandExample:** A basic command example for the addon.
- **Mixins:** Contains mixins for extending game functionality, including `ChatHelperScreenMixin` and `LanyardMixin`.
